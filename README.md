## Intro
This is a git repository for the [Catapult PGH][1] coworking space. This is the main repository for the community and the space. If something needs fixing or you have an idea to improve the coworking space, feel free to [submit a ticket](https://github.com/catapultpgh/main/issues/new).

## For New Members (Installation)

0. Join the Wireless Network (Optional): Our wireless network is "catapultpgh" without quotes. Ask someone for the password.
1. Donate: You can donate through [Gratipay][2]. We ask for a suggested donation of 9 dollars a day, but we don't keep track of individual member donations and we don't know who donates what, so feel free to do what you think is right.
2. If you need/want a key, come talk to someone about it.
