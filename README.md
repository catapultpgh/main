## For New Members (Installation)

1. Get on the wireless network: Our wireless network is "catapultpgh" without quotes. Ask someone for the password.
2. Request an invite for our internal google group [here][2]
3. Wait to get excepted to google group
4. [Group Calendar][3] - once you get on the email list, ask someone to get admin permissions to the calendar. Once you get admin permissions, you can reserve the conference room.
5. Basic membership is donation based. You can donate through [gittip][5]. We ask for a suggested donation of 9 dollars a day, but we don't keep track of individual member donations and we don't know who donates what, so feel free to do what you think is right.
6. Someone is always in the space from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. If you need/want a key, come talk to someone about it.
