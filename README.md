# catapultpgh

## Intro
This is a git repository for the [Catapult PGH][1] coworking space (go [here](https://github.com/catapultpgh/catapultpgh.github.io) for the website repo). This is the main repository for the community and the space. If something needs fixing or you have an idea to improve the coworking space, feel free to [submit a ticket](https://github.com/catapultpgh/main/issues/new).

## For New Members (Installation)

0. Join the Wireless Network (Optional): Our wireless network is "catapultpgh" without quotes. Ask someone for the password.
1. **Pick a payment amount.** Catapult is run in a "pay what you feel" model. This is not a typical donation model such as NPR where each member *assumes* others are covering their costs. There are no members covering your costs, and all payments are public, as all of catapult financial transations are public.
2. If you need/want a key, fill out the form here [catapult key form][catapultpgh.org/key-policy.pdf]
