## For New Members (Installation)

0. Join the Wireless Network (Optional): Our wireless network is "catapultpgh" without quotes. Ask someone for the password.
1. Join the Email List: google group [here][2]
2. Join the [Group Calendar][3]: once you get on the email list, ask someone to get admin permissions to the calendar. Once you get admin permissions, you can reserve the conference room.
3. Donate: You can donate through [gittip][5]. We ask for a suggested donation of 9 dollars a day, but we don't keep track of individual member donations and we don't know who donates what, so feel free to do what you think is right.
4. If you need/want a key, come talk to someone about it.
