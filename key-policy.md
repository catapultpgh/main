## Keys to the Castle

Catapult is a community first and a space second. We all rely on each other to take care of the
space. **There’s no lock that can protect a space from people with keys.** Instead of seeing this as
an obstacle, we see it as an opportunity. In order for new members to get keys, new members
need to get signatures from 4 current members. This gives members a chance to meet “The
New Kid” and also show new members all the quirks of the space.
