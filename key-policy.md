####Welcome to Catapult PGH! Here's some info we think you might like to know:
#####Catapult is a community first and a space second. 
* get to know the people who work around you! we encourage interaction among members, both socially and professionally.
* use the Face Wall to put names with faces: that’s what it’s there for. 

#####Catapult membership and pricing are flexible, with the intention of fostering a space built on gifts, rather than demands...a free flow of value (money and human capital) added to and taken from the space, because we understand that ability to pay may vary and that members use the space in different ways. 
* this is not a typical donation model such as NPR where each member assumes others are covering their costs. there are no members covering your costs, and all payments are public, as catapult financial information is available to all members
* you can make one-time, weekly, or re-curring monthly contributions via our website (www.catapultpgh.org), where you'll find suggested rates.
* there are no contracts or long-term commitments.
* everyone has access to catapult amenities (printing, coffee, keg, etc.), regardless of membership level.

#####We all rely on each other to take care of the space. Please be a responsible member of the community by:
* keeping the work surfaces clean
* emptying the kitchen trash can when it’s full
* cleaning out your old food from the fridge
* loading / unloading the dishwasher
* generally cleaning up any messes you make

#####The street entrance is unlocked between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays. 
* it also is open on weekend days when members are here, which is often, but not always. 
* once you’ve settled in as a member, you may obtain a key for full access (see "Keys to the Castle" below). 

#####It’s up to you to get involved!
* we have a system of stewards for things like maintenance, capital improvements, social events, finances, and community culture. ask around to figure out who they are if you want to help out in any way.
* if you have questions or suggestions, grab another member and have a conversation about it. also, come to happy hours and town hall meetings (check bulletin boards and slack for more info).
* if you want to do something to improve the space: apologize, don't ask for permission.

#### How to Become a Member of Catapult PGH
##### Keys to the Castle
**There’s no lock that can protect a space from people with keys.** Instead of seeing this as an obstacle, we see it as an opportunity. In order to integrate new members, we ask that they get signatures from at least 4 current members. This gives members a chance to meet “The New Kid” and also show new members all the quirks of the space. After you've settled in as a member, if you need a key for off-hour access, that can be arranged.
