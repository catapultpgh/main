# Receiving Sorting and Sending Physical Mail

## Receiving

Our mailing address is:
  
4327 Butler St  
Pittsburgh PA 15201  
  
We have mail cubbies in the front of the office with numbers and names. If you'd like a mailbox, put your name on it. If you'd like to get mail, add the number of the box to incoming mail, like this:
  

Some One  
4327 Butler St  
Suite 12  
Pittsburgh PA 15201  
  
## Sorting

The mail is community sorted. If you see mail in front of the mail cubbies, pick up the stack and put mail with Suite numbers in to cubbies with matching numbers. No one is currently responsible for sorting mail. Sometimes mail piles up unsorted. Be warned.

## Sending Physical Mail

Since we have so many members, on most days we have a UPS employee come to the space. There is a place to leave your pre-packaged UPS deliveries to be picked up. Again, this is an ad-hock system.
